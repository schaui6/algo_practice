##Data Structures
# Link List
* Provides better memory management than arrays.
* Linked lists are allocated memory at run time, so there is no waste in memory.
* Slower than array because there is no direct access to linked list elements.
* Useful data structure when the number of elements to be stored is not known ahead of time.
* Types of linked lists: linear, circular, doubly, and doubly circular.
