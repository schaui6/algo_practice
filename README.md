# Algorithms and Data Structures Practice

##Data Structures
### Link List
Advantages:
* Provides better memory management than arrays.
* Linked lists are allocated memory at run time, so there is no waste in memory.
* Useful data structure when the number of elements to be stored is not known ahead of time.
* Items can be added or removed from the middle of the list.

Disadvantages:
* Slower than array because there is no direct access to linked list elements.
* Nodes must be read in order from the beginning as linked lists are inherently
* usre more memory than arrays because of the storage used by their pointers.
* Nodes are stored incontiguously, greatly increasing the time required to access individual elements within the list, especially with CPU cache.
* Difficulties arise in linked lists when it comes to reverse traversing. For instance, singly linked lists are cumbersome to navigate backwards and while doubly linked lists are somewhat easier to read, memory is wasted in allocation space for a back-pointer.

Types of linked lists:
* linear
* circular
* doubly
* doubly circular
